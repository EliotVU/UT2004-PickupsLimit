With this mutator you can set a limit to how many times a player may pick up a specific Item such as Weapons, and health vials, etc!
A player will remain restricted until the end of the match.

Feel free to use it on your server, you can grab the necessary files(+source code) from https://github.com/EliotVU/UT2004-PickupsLimit/releases.
